    "# A minimum-cost bicing flow to guarantee a number of bicycles and docks in every station\n",
    "\n",
    "Barcelona bicing users have a natural tendency of preferring downward-sloping streets. This creates an unbalanced distribution of bicycles, concentrating most of them in the lower part of the city. This phenomenon is often compensated by a counterflow generated by the trucks that transport bicycles in the opposite direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "We would like to estimate the cost of transporting bicycles to compensate unbalanced distributions. In this exercise, we will consider a simplified version of the problem with the following assumptions:\n",
    "* We want to guarantee a minimum number of available bicycles and empty docks at every station of the city. For that, we will need to transfer bicycles from certain stations to other stations.\n",
    "* The cost of moving a bicycle is proportional to the distance that it has to travel across the edges of the current geometric graph of your application. This model is not realistic since we know that the cost of transporting 10 bicycles is not 10 times the cost of transporting one bicycle. However, this unrealistic model can still give a good estimation and make the computation affordable with the functions provided by the `NetworkX` package.\n",
    "* **Goal:** to determine how many bicycles must be transfered such that the minimum requirements for bicycles and docks are met and the transportation cost is minimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, your new command should have the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```/distribute 4 3```\n",
    "\n",
    "indicating that we want to guarantee 4 bicycles and 3 empty docks at each bicing station. \n",
    "The output of the command should be something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Total cost of transferring bicycles: 109.63 km\n",
    "3 -> 6: 3 bicycles\n",
    "345 -> 412: 2 bicycles\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where `3->6` represents the edge between stations with id 3 and 6, respectively. Please, do not report the edges that transport 0 bicycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Notice that `/distribute 0 0` should not generate any transportation and the cost should be `0 km`. Notice also that `/distribute 100 100` might be unfeasible. This situation should also be reported properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below you will find some hints on how to implement this part of the project. In fact, very little has to be done to complete the project."

Similarly, all bikes received by the node (black->red edges) are compensated by the docks donated by the node (red->green edges).
